# Purpose of this git
This is my first git repo, initially I'm going to use it to design my game, I'm a Scottish Programmer (not a games programmer but I'm learning) I have experience with C#, Java, Python and a few more but none worth mentioning.

Consequently - I'm going to try to create a game themed around the idea of 'programming' - I have no doubt it won't be much of a success but it's a start and it might get me ready to try a Game Jam or something.

Wish me luck!
